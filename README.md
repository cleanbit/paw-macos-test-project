## Tech stack

- Swift
- AppKit (no SwiftUI)
- No 3rd party libraries

## ETA

3-4 hours

## TODO

### Implement an application with the following features:

- Create data structure that will be used for JSON (sample is provided below);
- Fill data structure with random data;
- Send request `POST` to `https://httpbin.org/anything`;
- Parse response and display JSON tree from `data` field;
- Keep history of requests/responses and allow to switch between them;

### General requirements

- All non-UI operation must be executed on non-main thread;
- Make nice UI;
- Push your solution to a public github repo and provide setup instructions if any;
